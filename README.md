<p align="justify">
This is module contains some QOL improvements that me and my players have found interesting and/or useful for the <a href="https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-foundryvtt">Cypher System</a> made by <strong>mrkwnzl</strong>.
Those things could probably be implemented directly inside the system in the future. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Scripts

<p align="justify">
All of them are well-commented/documented and normally kept as understandable as possible for anyone to pick and modify/patch them as they wish.
I have no business in keeping anything obfuscated and blind. My main thoughts are that everyone has to start somewhere and understanding other code is one way to do so. 
With this, I aim to keep those different scripts as light as possible.

<p align="justify">
However, everyone has his/her/its/their own way to code and mine is mine, so if you were not able to understand something, please feel free to ask me on Discord.
