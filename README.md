<p align="justify">
This is module contains some QOL improvements that me and my players have found interesting and/or useful for the <a href="https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-foundryvtt">Cypher System</a> made by <strong>mrkwnzl</strong>.
Those things could probably be implemented directly inside the system in the future. Nothing more, nothing less.

If you need to speak about this module or about the Cypher System you can join <strong>mrkwnzl's</strong> <a href="https://discord.gg/C5zGgtyhwa">Cypher FVTT Dev Discord</a>. We will be happy to help!

## Scripts

<p align="justify">
All of them are well-commented/documented and normally kept as understandable as possible for anyone to pick and modify/patch them as they wish.
I have no business in keeping anything obfuscated and blind. My main thoughts are that everyone has to start somewhere and understanding other code is one way to do so. 
With this, I aim to keep those different scripts as light as possible.
</p>

<p align="justify">
However, everyone has his/her/its/their own way to code and mine is mine, so if you were not able to understand something, please feel free to ask me on Discord.
</p>

## Future

<p align="justify">
I am currently looking at expending the trade button to other actor sheet (shuch as NPC).

## How to use

> All are optionnal and can be deactivated in the settings.

### GMi token HUD

This will create a new token HUD component that will send the GMi for the player's token.

### Auto obfuscate and level roll an object

Those two options permit to automatically roll/obfuscate the level a numenera object (Cypher and Artifact) when dropped on a character sheet.

### Trade dialogue

This will show a new icon on your character sheet, making possible to trade items between player (need to have at least the **OBSERVER** permission).
